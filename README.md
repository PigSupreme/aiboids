# AiBoids: Reynolds-style BOIDS and Steering Behaviours in Python

In the aftermath of the world NOT ending in 2012, I found myself with some free time and finally committed to learning Python. Having taught myself programming sometime during the Dark Ages (MS-BASIC and TurboPascal...thar be dragons!), I tend to find introductory tutorials rather boring. This was my attempt to do something more challenging and engaging.

This work was inspired by and draws heavily from:
* (Craig Reynolds BOIDS Page)[http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/] and his paper Steering Behaviours for Autonomous Characters.
* (Programming Game AI by Example)[http://www.ai-junkie.com/books/toc_pgaibe.html] by Mat Buckland.

Currently uses Python 3.8 with Pygame 2.0.0 for real-time 2D rendering.
